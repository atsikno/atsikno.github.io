The Products transacted through the Service are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this license, unless a Product is accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. The licensor (“Application Provider”) reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. The Product that is subject to this license is referred to in this license as the “Licensed Application.”
</p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
a. Scope of License: This license granted to You for the Licensed Application by Application Provider is limited 
to a non-transferable license to use the Licensed Application on any 
Android phone or tablet that You own or 
control. This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any Android phone or tablet that 
You do not own or control, and You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available 
over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. 
You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. 
You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license
), 
decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative 
works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any 
foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing 
terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do 
so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider and its licensors. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the original Product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
</p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Application Provider may collect and use technical data and related 
information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application 
software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, 
product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Application Provider 
may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve its 
products or to provide services or technologies to You.
 You further acknowledge that the Licensed Application 
enables the use of location-based functionality (GPS). To the extent You use the location-based Services, You 
agree that that Application Provider, or any third party designated by Application Provider, may collect, 
transmit or otherwise use such positioning data for the purpose of providing the location-based Services.
</p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
c. Termination. The license is effective until terminated by You or Application Provider. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Application Provider if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.
</p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
d. Services; Third Party Materials. The Licensed Application may enable access to Application Provider’s and 
third party services and web sites (collectively and individually, "Services"). Use of the Services may 
require Internet access and that You accept additional terms of service. You understand that by using any 
of the Services, You may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which 
content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or 
entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to 
objectionable material. Nevertheless, You agree to use the Services at Your sole risk and that the 
Application Provider shall not have any liability to You for content that may be found to be offensive, 
indecent, or objectionable. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, 
information, applications or materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to 
certain third party web sites. By using the Services, You acknowledge and agree that the Application Provider 
is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, 
copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web 
sites. The Application Provider does not warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability

or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other 
web sites are provided solely as a convenience to You. Financial information displayed by any Services is for 
general informational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon as investment advice. Before 
executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the Services, You should consult 
with a financial professional. Location data provided by any Services is for basic navigational purposes only 
and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where 
erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental 
damage. Neither the Application Provider, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the availability, 
accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information or location data displayed by any 
Services. You agree that any Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is protected 
by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that You will 
not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of 
the Services. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to 
modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, 
and You shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, by 
trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, 
abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that the 
Application Provider is not in any way responsible for any such use by You, nor for any harassing, threatening,
defamatory, offensive or illegal messages or transmissions that You may receive as a result of using any of the 
Services. In addition, third party Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on 
or linked to from the Android phone or tablet are not available in all languages or in all countries. The 
Application Provider makes no representation that such Services and Materials are appropriate or available 
for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose to access such Services or Materials, You do so 
at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited 
to applicable local laws. The Application Provider, and its licensors, reserve the right to change, suspend, 
remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will the Application Provider 
be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. The Application Provider may also 
impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

f. Limitation of Liability.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Application Provider’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
