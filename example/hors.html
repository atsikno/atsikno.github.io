House of the Rising Sun

Intro: Am  C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
 
      Am   C        D     F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E   E
They call the Risin' Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
    Am     E        Am
And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor.

She sewed my new blue jeans.
   Am     C     D        F
My father was a gamblin' man

way Down in New Or-leans.
 
Interlude: C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
 
         Am   C       D       F
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
     Am       C     E     E
Is a suitcase and a trunk
        Am   C         D          F
And the only time that he's satis-fied
   Am        E     Am
Is when he's all a drunk

Solo - 
 
    Am     C          D        F
Oh, Mother, tell your children
       Am      C      E     E
Not to do what I have done.
Am         C        D          F
Spend your lives in sin and misery
       Am           E      Am
In the house of the risin' sun.

    Am    C           E     E
the other foot on the train.
    Am    C       D           F
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
   Am        E        Am
To wear that ball and chain.

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
    Am     E        Am
And God, I know I'm one.
